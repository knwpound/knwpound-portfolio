      directly with <i>real users</i> to bridge the gap between legacy systems

      This was my first side project, focusing on redesigning an{" "}
      <mark className="bg-blue-100 px-1">outdated website</mark> into a{" "}
      <b>modern and academic interface</b>. I aimed to create a{" "}
      <i>unique design</i> with <b>distinctive interactions</b> and elements
      that stand out from traditional academic layouts.
    </p>

    <p className="text-sm text-justify">
      The process covered <b>Requirement Gathering</b>,{" "}
      <i>Application Auditing</i>, and creating{" "}
      <mark className="bg-emerald-100 px-1">Low-Fidelity Wireframes</mark>. This
      led to a consistent <b>Design System</b>, <b>High-Fidelity Wireframes</b>,
      and a <i>Clickable Prototype</i> for final user testing.

      A mobile application designed for{" "}
      <mark className="bg-orange-100 px-1">non-trainer fitness users</mark>. I
      focused on defining <b>user personas</b> and refining the experience
      through <i>iterative design</i> to ensure the interface was intuitive for
      beginners.
    </p>

    <p className="text-sm text-justify">
      The process moved from <b>Requirement Gathering</b> to creating{" "}
      <i>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</i>. I then established a{" "}
      <mark className="bg-blue-100 px-1">structured Design System</mark> and{" "}
      <b>High-Fidelity Wireframes</b>, resulting in a <i>Clickable Prototype</i>{" "}
